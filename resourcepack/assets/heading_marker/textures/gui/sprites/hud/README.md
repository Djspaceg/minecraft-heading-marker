# Custom HUD Icons

This directory is intended for custom heading marker icons that will appear on the compass overlay HUD.

## Icon Specifications

- **Format:** PNG with transparency
- **Size:** 16x16 pixels (or multiples like 32x32, 64x64 for HD)
- **Color depth:** 32-bit RGBA
- **Naming convention:** Use descriptive names like `marker_red.png`, `marker_blue.png`, etc.

## Example Icons to Create

You can create custom marker icons for different waypoint types:

- `marker_red.png` - Red waypoint marker
- `marker_blue.png` - Blue waypoint marker
- `marker_green.png` - Green waypoint marker
- `marker_yellow.png` - Yellow waypoint marker
- `marker_purple.png` - Purple waypoint marker
- `marker_orange.png` - Orange waypoint marker
- `marker_home.png` - Home location marker
- `marker_spawn.png` - Spawn point marker
- `marker_mine.png` - Mine/resource location marker
- `marker_farm.png` - Farm location marker

## Usage

Once created, these icons can be referenced in the resource pack to display on the HUD when players have lodestone compasses pointing to different waypoints.

The color coding can be achieved by placing different colored carpets on lodestones before linking compasses to them.

## Design Tips

- Keep designs simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use bright, contrasting colors that stand out on the HUD
- Include a slight drop shadow or outline for better visibility
- Test icons in-game with different backgrounds
- Consider color-blind friendly palettes
